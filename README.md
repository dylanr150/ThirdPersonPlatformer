Player can:
  - Look around using third person free-look camera.
  - Move around in the environment and the forward direction is determined by the camera rotation.
  - Jump to elevated platforms.
  - Tune jump height and movement speed parameters to make the platformer well controlled (4 speed, 13 jump height felt the best to me).

The Environment Contains:
  - Boxes to jump onto and invisible walls that prevent falling.
  - Coins that rotate on top of boxes to collect.
  - When these coins are collected, they disappear and update the score value in the UI (top right).

Maintained proper git history, frequently committing when changes were made with relevant commit messages.
Readme file has video.

I also believe I maintained single responsibility principle and a consistent coding style with appropriate logic grouped together.
